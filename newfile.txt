The modern Marathi language evolved from the Maharashtri Prakrit,[20] and the word Marhatta (later used for the Marathas) is found in the Jain Maharashtrian literature. The term Maharashtra (Marathi: महाराष्ट्र) along with Maharashtrian, Marathi, and Maratha may have derived from the same root. However, their exact etymology is uncertain.[21]

The most widely accepted theory among the linguistic scholars is that the words Maratha and Maharashtra ultimately derived from a combination of Mahā (Marathi: महा) and Rāshtrikā (Marathi: राष्ट्रिका),[21][22] the name of a tribe or dynasty of chiefs ruling in the Deccan region.[23] An alternate theory states that the term is derived from Mahā ("great") and ratha/rathi (chariot/charioteer), which refers to a skilful northern fighting force that migrated southward into the area.[23][22]

An alternative theory states that the term derives from the word Mahā ("great") and Rāshtra ("nation/dominion").[24] However, this theory is somewhat controversial among modern scholars who believe it to be the sanskritised interpretation of later writers
